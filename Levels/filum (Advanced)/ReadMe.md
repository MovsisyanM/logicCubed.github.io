This level requires the user to dig into the strings of the executable file and find the credentials. After logging in the person will be able to see the flag. Otherwise they can brute force their way in, however that option is not encouraged.

The language used to create this level is C#, using the .net framework and XAML for WPF

Users should use ILSpy
