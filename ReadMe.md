*Welcome to the Logic Cubed!*
***
This is a CTF that has one goal.
The goal of Logic Cubed is to introduce the concept and benefits of CTFs to beginners, allowing them to do puzzles without time limits, allowing them to explore multiple ways of solving puzzles and finding vulnerabilities. This will hopefully result in more people gaining interest towards cyber secutiry.

If you find bugs, this is what you have to do:
 Step 1: Determine if the bug is funny or not
 Step 2: If (Step1() == true) {Post it on r/softwaregore}
:)
